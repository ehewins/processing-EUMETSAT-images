# Processing EUMETSAT Images

This repository contains Ellis Hewins' and Mohammed Aslam's (a.k.a. Suhail's) code for the project "Remote sensing using EUMETSAT data", which forms part of the module "Imaging and Data Processing" of our masters year at Nottingham University.

Note that the `images` folder is empty. On our local machines, this folder contains 2190 images from a geostationary meteorological satellite forming part of the EUMETSAT "meteosat" cluster. Given that the contents of this folder are 2.6 GB in size, it is not possible to store these images on GitHub.
